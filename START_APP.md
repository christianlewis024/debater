## Deploying Security Rules

After testing locally, deploy your security rules:

```bash
cd C:\Users\chris\OneDrive\Desktop\PROGRAMMING\debate
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only database
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you see errors about missing modules:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**If Firebase connection fails:**
- Check that .env.local exists in the client folder
- Make sure all Firebase services are enabled in console
