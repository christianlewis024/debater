# Waitlist System Implementation Guide

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Feature:** Self-Moderated Debate Waitlist System

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete waitlist system for self-moderated debates, allowing the host to debate multiple challengers sequentially. Viewers can join a waitlist with their CON stance, and the host can accept challengers one at a time.

---

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Waitlist Service (`waitlistService.js`)

**Functions:**
- `joinWaitlist(debateId, userId, username, photoURL, stance)` - Join waitlist as CON
- `leaveWaitlist(debateId, userId)` - Leave waitlist
- `subscribeToWaitlist(debateId, callback)` - Real-time waitlist updates
- `acceptFromWaitlist(debateId, userId, userData)` - Accept user as debater_b
- `removeDebater(debateId)` - Remove current debater_b and reset debate state

**Database Structure:**
```
debates/{debateId}/waitlist/{userId}
├── userId: string
├── username: string
├── photoURL: string
├── stance: string (max 150 chars)
├── joinedAt: Timestamp
└── position: "con" (always CON for self-moderated)
```

### ✅ 2. WaitlistPanel Component

**Features:**
- **For All Users:**
  - Real-time waitlist display (publicly visible)
  - Shows position number, avatar, username, and CON stance
  - Ordered by join time (first-come, first-served)

- **For Viewers:**
  - "Join Waitlist" button
  - Form to enter CON stance (150 char limit)
  - "Leave Waitlist" button (if already joined)
  - Visual indicator when user is on waitlist

- **For Host:**
  - "Remove Current Debater" button (removes debater_b)
  - "Accept" button next to each waitlist entry
  - Can only accept when no debater_b is present
  - Removing debater resets debate state

**UI Design:**
- Glassmorphism card design
- Position numbers with purple gradient
- User avatars with red border (CON side)
- Stance text with "CON:" prefix
- Highlight current user's entry in blue

### ✅ 3. Integration with VideoDebateRoom

**Added:**
- WaitlistPanel component import
- Conditional rendering (only for self-moderated debates)
- Passes props: debateId, currentUser, userProfile, isHost, debaterB, debateStructure

**Location:** Below paused indicator, before closing video container (line 1480-1492)

### ✅ 4. Firestore Security Rules

**Added waitlist rules:**
```javascript
match /waitlist/{userId} {
  allow read: if true; // Public visibility
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId; // Users create their own entry
  allow delete: if isSignedIn() && (
    request.auth.uid == userId || // Users can remove themselves
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/debates/$(debateId)).data.hostId == request.auth.uid // Host can remove anyone
  );
}
```

### ✅ 5. Bug Fix: +30s Button

**Issue:** Button wasn't providing feedback on errors
**Fix:** Added try-catch block with console logging (VideoDebateRoom.jsx:1350-1358)

## How It Works

### Flow for Viewers:
1. Viewer enters self-moderated debate as viewer (no media)
2. Clicks "Join Waitlist" button
3. Enters their CON stance in textarea (required, max 150 chars)
4. Clicks "Confirm Join"
5. Added to waitlist with position number
6. Can see their position in real-time
7. Can leave waitlist at any time

### Flow for Host:
1. Host creates self-moderated debate
2. Host is automatically debater_a (PRO side)
3. Accepts first challenger from waitlist → becomes debater_b (CON)
4. Starts debate and debates the challenger
5. When finished, clicks "Remove Current Debater"
6. Debate state resets (debateStarted: false)
7. Can accept next challenger from waitlist
8. Process repeats for each challenger

### Automatic Actions:
- Accepting a user removes them from waitlist
- Removing debater_b resets debate state to allow new debate
- Waitlist updates in real-time for all users
- Position numbers auto-update as users join/leave

---

## Database Operations

### Join Waitlist
```javascript
setDoc(debates/{debateId}/waitlist/{userId}, {
  userId: "user123",
  username: "john_doe",
  photoURL: "https://...",
  stance: "I believe X because Y",
  joinedAt: Timestamp.now(),
  position: "con"
})
```

### Accept from Waitlist
```javascript
// 1. Set debater_b participant
setDoc(debates/{debateId}/participants/debater_b, {
  userId: "user123",
  role: "debater_b",
  sideDescription: "I believe X because Y",
  profileData: { username, photoURL },
  joinedAt: Timestamp.now()
})

// 2. Remove from waitlist
deleteDoc(debates/{debateId}/waitlist/{userId})
```

### Remove Debater
```javascript
// 1. Delete debater_b participant
deleteDoc(debates/{debateId}/participants/debater_b)

// 2. Reset debate state if debate was ongoing
updateDoc(debateStates/{debateId}, {
  debateStarted: false,
  debateEnded: false,
  currentTurn: "debater_a",
  turnNumber: 1,
  paused: false
})
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test as Viewer:
1. Navigate to a self-moderated debate
2. Click "Join Waitlist"
3. Enter a stance (e.g., "I believe cats are better")
4. Verify you appear in waitlist with position #1
5. Open debate in incognito window
6. Join as another user - verify position #2
7. Click "Leave Waitlist" - verify removal

### Test as Host:
1. Create self-moderated debate
2. Verify waitlist panel appears
3. Have 2+ users join waitlist
4. Click "Accept" on first user
5. Verify user becomes debater_b
6. Verify user removed from waitlist
7. Start debate
8. After debating, click "Remove Current Debater"
9. Verify debater_b removed
10. Verify debate state reset

12. Repeat process

### Test Real-Time Updates:
1. Open debate in 3 tabs (1 host, 2 viewers)
2. Join waitlist from viewer tab 1
3. Verify all tabs see update instantly
4. Join from viewer tab 2
5. Verify position numbers update in all tabs
6. Accept user from host tab

## UI Components

```
📋 Waitlist (0)                    [✋ Join Waitlist]

    No one waiting
Be the first to join the waitlist!
```

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority:
1. **Notification System:**
   - Notify user when they're next in line
   - Notify user when accepted by host
   - Push notifications when debate starts

2. **Enhanced Moderation:**
   - Host can skip users in waitlist
   - Host can ban users from rejoining
   - Time limits per debate round

### Medium Priority:
3. **Statistics:**
   - Track total debates per user
   - Win/loss record in self-moderated
   - Average stance quality (votes)

4. **Waitlist Customization:**
   - Host sets max waitlist size
   - Auto-close waitlist when full
   - Require approval before joining

### Low Priority:
5. **Advanced Features:**
   - Multiple concurrent challengers (panel format)
   - Voting on best challenger stance
   - Waitlist queue management (drag-and-drop reorder)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Challenger:** Only one debater_b at a time (by design)
2. **No Waitlist Expiry:** Users stay on waitlist indefinitely
3. **No Position Saving:** Leaving and rejoining puts you at end of queue
4. **Stance Character Limit:** Hard 150 character limit (no line breaks)
5. **Host Only:** Only self-moderated debates have waitlist

---

## Summary

- Waitlist database service with 5 core functions
- WaitlistPanel component with full UI
- Real-time updates for all users
- Host controls (accept/remove)
